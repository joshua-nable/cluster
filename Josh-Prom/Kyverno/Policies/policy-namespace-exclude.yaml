  name: exclude-namespace-names
  annotations:
      As application workloads share cluster resources, it is important to limit resources 
      requested and consumed by each pod. It is recommended to require 'resources.requests' 
      and 'resources.limits.memory' per pod. If a namespace level request or limit is specified, 
      defaults will automatically be applied to each pod based on the 'LimitRange' configuration.
